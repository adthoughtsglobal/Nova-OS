NovaOS is a powerful web system built for everything. From daily tasks to endless fun, it has you covered. A customizable system designed for any device with a browser. It offers a fast, secure, and feature-rich experience for gaming and daily tasks, with dynamic personalization and seamless updates.

# What makes it special?
- NovaOS is the **completely free**, **mobile supported**, **PWA installable**, **fully local** **web desktop** system. It has a fully self-created ecosystem of features and a very unique user experience.

- NovaOS is one of the most reliable web systems, thanks to its fully local nature and a codebase built entirely on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

- NovaOS can function fully offline, it operates with all its features without an internet connection. Think of it this way: NovaOS is a fully client-side web application that lets you make full web applications that can interact with a virtual filesystem offline. 

- NovaOS can handle locally created web apps in a breeze, SVG icons, powerful settings, massive amounts of detail in each feature and a wide array of default apps to ease your work.
