NovaOS is a web system designed for any modern device with a browser. NovaOS apps can perform complex tasks more easily than native apps by simulating an abstract virtual system within the browser. 

Nova Ecosystem is a collection of features, including apps, themes, permission systems, and styling standards. NovaOS acts as a filesystem access layer and gives exactly what the apps need, no more-no less.

# Key features
- NovaOS is **completely free**, **mobile supported**, **fully local and offline** web system with a **web desktop** in a PWA.

- NovaOS is one of the most reliable web systems, which can function fully offline, thanks to its local-first nature and a codebase built entirely on pure HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

- NovaOS can easily handle locally created apps, plus, there's a suite of default applications to ease your work. There's also a store where you can see even more applications!

- NovaOS is designed for the user, not the technology. The system focuses on giving the most accurate experience that a user needs. Maintaining the balance between simplicity and efficiency in UI. Compromising flashy effects for varied use cases.
