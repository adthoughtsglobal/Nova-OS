NovaOS is a customizable web system designed for any device with a browser. With NovaOS, applications can easily do complex tasks just like native apps, on any modern device. It creates a fast, safe, and feature-rich experience for development and creative work, equipped with an array of personalization capabilities and immense stability.

# Key features
- NovaOS is the **completely free**, **mobile supported**, **PWA installable**, **fully local** system with a **web desktop**. It creates a fully self-contained system with files, apps, and the system.

- NovaOS is one of the most reliable web systems, thanks to its fully local nature and a codebase built entirely on pure HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS - just enough for the browser.

- NovaOS can function fully offline, creating a reliable system that stays resilient, yet can perform the tasks you need it to.

- NovaOS can easily handle locally created apps, plus, there's a suite of default applications to ease your work. Though there's a store where you can see even more applications!

- NovaOS is designed for the user, not the technology. The system focuses on giving the most accurate experience that a user needs. Maintaining the balance between simplicity and efficiency in UI.
