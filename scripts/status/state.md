# Planned
- **file copy paste** in files app
- **sorting** in files app
- better **clock app**
- **bin**: Move files to bin.
- files app **save as** mode

# Under construction
- NTX system: unified system for all app-os calls.
- 

# Planning
- in folder **app data** - Allow apps to save data.

# Proposed
- browser zoom buttons
- Haptic UI (sounds)

# Broken
